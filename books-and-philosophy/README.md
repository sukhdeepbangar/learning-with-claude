# Books and Philosophy

A space to collect discussions about books, ideas, and philosophical themes. This is not a structured learning path — it's a running record of conversations and reflections that happen naturally across sessions.

## How This Works

Unlike the other learning streams, there's no curriculum or phases here. When we discuss a book or philosophical idea during any session, the discussion gets captured here for future reference.

**Structure:**
- Each book or philosophical topic gets its own file
- Discussions are captured as notes — key ideas, questions raised, connections made
- Cross-links to other topics when ideas connect

**What goes here:**
- Book discussions (summaries, reactions, key takeaways)
- Philosophical ideas and frameworks
- Connections between books/philosophies and other learning streams
- Open questions and threads to revisit
